				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img id="dynamic-image" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c90396c9-17a9-4e9f-a660-9834e3d1736e/northern-lights.jpeg" alt="Northern Lights">

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspiring image:
					<br><br>
					Color - colors were taken from inspiring image using an [eyedropper tool](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en).
					<br><br>
					Primitives - rectangles were used for background, triangles for pine trees, and lines to simulate the Northern Lights.
					<br><br>
					Polygons - mountain was created using custom-shaped polygon involving noise() and random() in order to create more texture.
					<br><br>
					Generative - positioning of trees and mountains change as seed grows, as well as slight changes in Northern Lights positioning.
					<br><br>
					Life - Northern Lights moves across canvas in wavy pattern to simulate real world movement.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was largely a success but also had room for improvement. Although I am proud that I was able to replicate the Alaskan Northern Lights as best with my current abilities and knowledge, I felt like with more time and research I could've added more details to my design. However, I am very happy with how my design turned out especially with my Northern Lights and if I had more time I would've done more with my mountain such as adding a snow layer on top and maybe subtle clouds in the background.</p>
