				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project generates an infinite amount of grocery items for creating grocery lists.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The program uses procedural generation algorithms combined with unique hash values created by the user's world key in order to generate different grocery items. I utilized the hash function given by the instructor in order to shuffle through the grocery items that are placed on each tile. I also created a list that displays the items chosen by the user by using HTML manipulating functions such as .createElement and .textContent.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm very happy with how this experiment turned out. It may be the worst way to write out your grocery list, but I thought it was a fun way to utilize infinite generation and daily life. I was struggling a lot trying to figure out another way to use infinite generation creatively and got inspired by one of the suggestions given by the instructor which was having the tiles be dad jokes. I took this idea and decided to alter it in a way for users to keep track of groceries they want to buy. This experiment wasn't too difficult since this was my third one I did, but I did learn more about indexing in arrays when the user chooses an item. I also learned more about html when I added the grocery list that displays the items the user picked which I thought was cool to learn. I wish I had more time on this experiment in order to touch up the tiles however. One idea I had was categorizing the tiles based on the grocery item they had such as having red tiles represent meat, green tiles represent vegetables, and more. </p>

				<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
				<p>Infinity: I used the infinite extent of my world to represent an infinite display of groceries for creating grocery lists.<br><br>

					Variation of Space: As the audience browses my world, they'll see a variety of different grocery items.<br><br>
					
					Variation of Key: Different worlds will have different groceries placed on different tiles, allowing for users to shuffle through items.<br><br>
					
					Signs of Life: Clicking on tiles causes the grocery item to be added to the user's grocery list which will be seen below the generator.</p>
